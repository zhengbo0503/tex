\begin{itemize}
    \item On page 499, equation (48.21). This should be written as 
    \begin{equation}\notag
        a_{ij}^2 \geq \text{average of }\{a_{rs}^2: r< s\} = 
        {\color{red} \frac{\mathrm{off}(A)^2/2}{(n-1)n/2} = \frac{\mathrm{off}(A)^2}{(n-1)n}.}
    \end{equation}
    In this way, the equation (48.22) can be written as 
    \begin{equation}\notag
        \begin{aligned}
            \mathrm{off}(\wt A)^2 & = \mathrm{off}(A)^2 - 2a_{ij}^2
            \quad \text{by equation (48.20)}\\
            & \leq \mathrm{off}(A)^2 - 2 \left(\frac{\mathrm{off}(A)^2}{(n-1)n} \right) \\
            & = \left( 1- \frac{2}{(n-1)n}\right)\mathrm{off}(A)^2.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

        A good choice is $\epsilon_k = \mathrm{off}(A_k)/\sqrt{(n-1)n/2}$.
    \end{quotation}
    I notice that this is coming from \ycite[1998,
    Sec.~9.4.3]{Par1998TSEP}. From the settings in your book and
    the definition of $\omega$ in~\cite{Par1998TSEP}, we have 
    $$
        2\omega = \mathrm{off}(A_k)^2,\quad N = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
    $$
    Hence we get the 
    $$
        \epsilon_k := \tau = \sqrt{\omega/N} = 
        {\color{red} \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{off}(A_k)^2/2}{{n(n-1)}/2}} = \frac{\mathrm{off}(A_k)}{\sqrt{n(n-1)}},}
    $$
    instead of $\epsilon_k = \mathrm{off}(A_k)/\sqrt{(n-1)n/2}$ which is
    defined in your book.
    \item 
    In Algorithm 48.12, line 18, it should write $D = \diag(\diag(A))$.
    Since you haven't defined what $\lambda_i$s are.
    \item On page 501

        Convergence has been proved for the cyclic Jacobi method under mild assumptions. Both the classical and the cyclic method have asymptotic quadratic convergence.
    \end{quotation}
    As a reader, I think it's better if you could add
    some references for this 
    asymptotic quadratic convergence. Such as for classic Jacobi
    method~\cite{vKem1966OtCotCJMfRSMwNDE}, and for cyclic Jacobi
    method~\cite{1966-quadratic-convergence-vanKempen,
    Wil1962NotQCotCJP}.
